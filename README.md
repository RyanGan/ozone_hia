Approach to use Monte Carlo methods to estimate HIA forumla

## Things to do:

### Assemble dataframes
1. Jake to create dataframes for state-specific estimates
2. Ryan to use meta-analysis method to pool year-specific estimates of 0-17 asthma-ed rates from 2001 to 2009

### Analyses to rerun
Jake to rerun estimates of delta y using monte carlo approach for:

1. Entire U.S.
2. State-specific (updates maps)
3. Stratum-specific estimates (race, sex)
